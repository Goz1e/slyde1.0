Room logic : 

Private Room(
    non-members cannot-view == django view guardian
    settings page(
        update form = owner_only
        make and revoke admin = owner_only
        manage requests and members = admins and owner
    )
)


Aim : get author from different source, rather than msg.author

how (
    generate random room view :

    takes room_name and display_name:
    room is created
    display_name is stored in session.
    if user is not authenticated:
        display_name is used to create message
)

action (
    create form and use it to assign display_name
)
